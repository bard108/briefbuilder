# Brief Builder Enhancements Summary

**Date:** October 9, 2025  
**Version:** Production Build  
**Status:** ✅ All Features Implemented and Tested

---

## Overview

This document summarizes the major enhancements made to the Brief Builder application based on professional photography workflow requirements and UI/UX improvements.

---

## ✅ 1. Shot Quantity Field

### Implementation
- **Schema:** Added `quantity` field (optional number) to `shotSchema`
- **UI Enhancement:** New quantity input in shot list (side-by-side with category)
- **Visual Badge:** Shots with quantity > 1 show "×N versions" badge in header
- **Use Case:** Specify how many variations/versions of each shot are needed

### Example Usage
```typescript
{
  description: 'Hero product shot',
  quantity: 3,  // Need 3 variations with different angles
  ...
}
```

### User Benefits
- Clear communication of deliverable expectations
- Prevents confusion about "how many shots" per setup
- Helps photographers plan time and resources

---

## ✅ 2. Enhanced Video Deliverables

### New Video-Specific Fields

#### Schema Additions
- `videoDuration` (string) - e.g., "30 seconds", "1-2 minutes"
- `videoFrameRate` (string) - e.g., "24fps", "30fps", "60fps"
- `videoResolution` (string) - e.g., "4K", "1080p", "720p"
- `videoOrientation` (string[]) - Landscape (16:9), Portrait (9:16), Square (1:1)
- `motionRequirements` (textarea) - Describe motion capture needs

### UI Enhancement
When "Video" deliverable is selected, a new **indigo-colored section** appears with:
- 3 input fields for duration, frame rate, and resolution
- Checkbox group for video orientations
- Dedicated textarea for motion requirements (drizzle, steam, slow-mo, etc.)
- Social platform selection integrated

### Example Workflow
```
☑ Video (includes social video)
  Duration: 30 seconds
  Frame Rate: 30fps
  Resolution: 4K
  Orientation: ☑ Portrait (9:16) ☑ Square (1:1)
  Motion: "Capture slow-motion pour, steam rising, and drizzle action"
  Platforms: ☑ Instagram Reels ☑ TikTok
```

### User Benefits
- All video technical specs captured upfront
- Motion capture requirements explicitly documented
- Social platform formats specified during planning

---

## ✅ 3. Consolidated Deliverables

### Changes Made

#### Removed
- ❌ "Social Assets" as separate deliverable option
- ❌ "Other" as vague catch-all option

#### Updated
- ✅ **Photography (includes social assets)** - Consolidates all still image needs
- ✅ **Video (includes social video)** - Consolidates all motion content
- ✅ **Behind-the-Scenes Content** - Optional BTS deliverable

### Social Platform Integration
- Social platforms now appear **within Photography and/or Video sections**
- Same checkbox list appears contextually based on what's selected
- Platforms include:
  - Instagram Feed (1:1, 4:5)
  - Instagram Story/Reels (9:16)
  - Facebook Post
  - LinkedIn Post
  - TikTok (9:16)
  - YouTube

### User Benefits

## ✅ 4. Visual Grouping UI for Shot Lists

### Implementation

#### Automatic Grouping
- Shots automatically group by `category` field
- Each category becomes a **collapsible section**
- Ungrouped shots remain in flat list (backwards compatible)

#### Visual Features
- **Expandable/collapsible headers** with chevron indicator
- **Shot count** per category: "(5 shots)"
- **Priority count badge**: "2 must-have" in indigo
- **Smooth transitions** on expand/collapse
- **Nested shot cards** with proper spacing

### Example Display
```
▼ Hero Shots (3 shots) [2 must-have]
  Shot #1: Hero product on white background ⭐ MUST-HAVE ×3 versions
  Shot #2: Hero with lifestyle props
  Shot #3: Hero overhead angle ⭐ MUST-HAVE

▼ Detail Shots (4 shots) [1 must-have]
  Shot #4: Texture close-up ⭐ MUST-HAVE
  Shot #5: Label detail
  ...

▼ Lifestyle Shots (2 shots)
  Shot #8: In-use scenario
  Shot #9: Styled flat lay
```

### User Benefits
- **Long shot lists remain organized** and scannable
- Quick overview of shot categories and priorities
- Collapse irrelevant sections to focus on current work
- Drag-and-drop reordering still works within groups
